 # Rick and Morty Fan Site (Starter Pack Example)
 🔎 Looking for the perfect NextJS example using the latest and greatest? **You came to the right place!**
 - React/NextJS
 - Apollo GraphQL (SSR - server side rendering)
 - Redux
 - Tailwinds.css / Shadcn

 Data fetched via GraphQL API from [rickandmortyapi.com](https://rickandmortyapi.com)

# 🤷‍♂️ How to start?
Just run `pnpm run dev` (use `pnpm` instead of `npm` - [here's why](https://refine.dev/blog/pnpm-vs-npm-and-yarn/#why-not-npm-or-yarn))

# 🤨 Wait, there's no need to run `node myServer.js`?
No, NextJS is a framework that runs on top of NodeJS on port `3000` / `localhost:3000` with **its own default server.** For custom GraphQL server, REST API, authenticaion logic, etc - [you can create your own server](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/configuring/custom-server)

# 👷‍♂️ Work in progress
Feel free to contribute to this project so more people can get to use `NextJS` right out the box!

## 📌 Todos
- Use `localStorage` for persistence (after page reload) for likes in `/providers/redux-store.js`
- Keep states alive when going back/forward
- Keep using SSR practices going forward
